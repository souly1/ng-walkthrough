# ng-walkthrough

After not finding an Angular walkthrough/on-boarding/tour guide/learning page directive which was responsive, dynamic, easy to use and thus good for our [Fitness Meal Planner](http://www.fitnessmealplanner.com) mobile web App I decided to create one.

One of the most common design challenges emerging in mobile design is that of 'invitation' - creating an explanation walk through during user first interaction with the app so to engage him.
Following Theresa Neil's design patterns from [Mobile Design Pattern Gallery] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449314325/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=uxbo09-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1449314325)

This angular directive implements a walkthrough via one of the following patterns: the transparency pattern or the tip pattern (an explanation about the different patterns can be found online at [ux booth](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/mobile-design-patterns/))

# Special features
 - Use the transparency walkthrough either using transclude or given attributes which contain basics such as text, gesture image, 'got it' button
 - In transparency walkthrough easily highlight a DOM element (see demo)
 - Use any image you want or choose a gesture image from the given collection (such as swipe with direction or tap) and place it bound to the element mentioned above.
 - automatically moves text to bottom if item is covering the text with icon or arrow
 - In tip mode add an Icon to sit on top or behind the tip text box

## ScreenShots

# Demo

A demo was created to show:
 * The 2 basic transparency overlay types in 3 demoes fitting the screenshot examples -  one basic template, one with arrows, and the last freestyle one using transclude.
 * The tip mode walkthrough

## Requirements

- AngularJS
- No need for JQuery as JQLite is used

## Notes

This directive has been originally developed for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com), so it supports both angular and ionic apps.

## Installation

* **NPM**: `npm install ng-walkthrough`
* **Bower**: `bower install ng-walkthrough`

## Usage

- Load the script files in your application:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="wherever-you-put-it/ng-walkthrough.css">

<script type="text/javascript" src="wherever-you-put-it/ng-walkthrough.js"></script>
```

Add dependencies on the `ng-walkthrough` AngularJS module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ng-walkthrough']);
```

If you want to use the directives supplied tap icons add this script file:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="wherever-you-put-it/ng-walkthrough.tap_icons.js"></script>
```

You can now use the directive, add the element to your HTML:
```html
<walkthrough walkthrough-type="X">
  ...
</walkthrough>
```
and use one of the two configurations:
    1> Place any HTML code as you like instead of the three dotes as this uses the Angular transclude ability. Make sure to specify walkthrough-type="transparency" or "tip" for this to work.
    2> Use the additional optional properties the directive has to quickly create a walkthrough screen.

## Usage Example 1 - transparency Non transclude option

```html
<walkthrough
            is-round=true
            walkthrough-type="transparency"
            focus-element-id="focusItem"
            icon="single_tap"
            main-caption="This is some text"
            is-active="isActive"
            use-button=true>
</walkthrough>
```

## Usage Example 2 - transparency using transclude option

```html
<walkthrough is-active="isActive" walkthrough-type="transparency">
  <img src="images/ImageTutorialExample.png" style="height: 100vh; width: 100%;">
</walkthrough>
```

## Usage Example 3 - tip type walkthrough

```html
<walkthrough
            walkthrough-type="tip"
            icon="images/myLogo.png"
            tip-icon-location="FRONT"
            tip-location="TOP"
            main-caption="This is some text"
            tip-color="BLACK"
            is-active="isActive"
            use-button=true>
</walkthrough>
```
